# Specification Folder — Structure & Guide

This folder contains all product specifications in **OpenSpec format**. Specifications are the source of truth for what gets built — all code in `solutions/` (across all project repositories) must trace back to a spec here.

## OpenSpec Format Quick Reference

All specification files use YAML front matter + structured markdown sections:

```yaml
---
spec_id: SPEC-NNN
title: "[Descriptive Title]"
version: "0.1.0"
status: draft | review | approved | implemented | deprecated
type: business | technical | validation
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
authors:
  - [Agent Role or Human Name]
---
```

**Required Sections** (varies by type):
- `## Overview` — Purpose, scope, background
- `## Actors` (business specs) — Who interacts with the system
- `## User Stories` (business specs) — As a/I want/So that format
- `## Acceptance Criteria` — Given/When/Then scenarios
- `## Non-Functional Requirements` — Performance, security, reliability
- `## Constraints` — Hard limits
- `## Open Questions` — Unresolved items with owners

For the full format reference: `.github/instructions/openspec-format.md`
For authoring guidance: `.github/skills/openspec-authoring.md`

## Spec Status Lifecycle

```
draft ──► review ──► approved ──► implemented ──► deprecated
```

- **draft:** Being authored. Not yet ready for review.
- **review:** Ready for stakeholder review. May still change.
- **approved:** Locked for implementation. Changes require formal change request.
- **implemented:** All stories derived from this spec are delivered.
- **deprecated:** Superseded or descoped. Do not use for new work.

---

## Traceability Chain

Every deliverable in `solutions/` must trace back through this chain:

```
spec/business/frame.md (actor goals)
    ↓
spec/business/requirements.md (functional requirements)
    ↓
spec/business/backlog.md (user stories)
    ↓
spec/validation/acceptance-criteria.md (acceptance criteria)
    ↓
spec/iterations/iteration-N/stories/STORY-XXX.md (iteration story spec)
    ↓
solutions/<project-name>/ (implementation code + tests)
```

Story specs include a `projects` field listing which repositories under `solutions/` are affected.

If code exists in `solutions/` with no corresponding spec entry, it was built without a spec — this is a process violation and should be addressed in the next iteration.

---

## Creating New Spec Documents

1. Copy the template from `.github/instructions/openspec-format.md`
2. Assign the next available `spec_id` in the appropriate range
3. Set status to `draft`
4. Fill in all required sections
5. Change status to `review` when ready for stakeholder review
6. Get approval from the relevant agent roles
7. Change status to `approved` before work begins

---

## Searching Specs

To find all specs related to a topic:
```bash
grep -r "authentication" spec/ -l
grep -r "STORY-001" spec/ -l
grep -r "spec_id: SPEC-01" spec/ 
```

# GitHub Copilot Workspace Instructions — FORGE Template

> **You are operating inside the FORGE AI-assisted SDLC Template.**
> This file is the primary entry point for GitHub Copilot in this workspace.
> Read this file fully before taking any action.

## Terminology

- **Product**: The overall system managed by this scaffold. One scaffold repository per product. Example: "Acme Platform".
- **Project**: A single Git repository / service that is part of the product (e.g. `acme-api`, `acme-web`, `acme-mobile`, `acme-iac`). Each project lives in its own subdirectory under `solutions/`.

---

## What Is This Template?

This repository is a **FORGE Framework Template** — a structured methodology for AI-assisted software development using GitHub Copilot CLI. FORGE stands for:

| Phase | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **F** | Frame — Define the vision, goals, scope, and constraints |
| **O** | Obstruct — Surface blockers, unknowns, risks, and gaps |
| **R** | Reconstruct — Resolve obstructions and refine specifications |
| **G** | Generate — Produce code, infrastructure, tests, and documentation |
| **E** | Edit — Review, refine, and polish all artifacts |

The template integrates:
- **Dan Shapiro's 5 Levels of Vibe Coding** — targeting Levels 4 (Engineered Vibe) and 5 (Dark Factory)
- **StrongDM Dark Factory Model** — fully automated, agent-driven development using parallel git worktree fleets
- **OpenSpec.dev Format** — structured, AI-readable specification format
- **Agile SDLC Loop** — Discovery → Specification → Backlog → Grooming → Iteration Planning → Development → Review/QA → Release

This scaffold supports **multiple projects** (repositories) under a single product umbrella. Coordinated changes across microservices, frontends, mobile apps, and infrastructure are managed together with shared specifications and cross-project stories.

---

## Two Operating Modes

### Mode 1: Greenfield (New Project)
Start from scratch. Run the greenfield init prompt to kick off the FORGE Frame phase.

```
Use prompt: .github/prompts/project/greenfield-init.prompt.md
```

Steps:
1. Open `.github/prompts/project/greenfield-init.prompt.md` in Copilot
2. Answer the clarifying questions about your product and its projects
3. Copilot will run the Frame phase and populate `spec/business/`
4. Continue through the SDLC flow

### Mode 2: Brownfield (Existing Codebase)
Clone your existing project repositories into the `solutions/` folder, then run the brownfield analysis prompt.

```
Use prompt: .github/prompts/project/brownfield-analysis.prompt.md
```

Steps:
1. Clone each project repository into `solutions/`:
   ```bash
   cd solutions
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/acme-api
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/acme-web
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/acme-mobile
   cd ..
   ```
2. Open `.github/prompts/project/brownfield-analysis.prompt.md` in Copilot
3. Copilot will scan all projects in `solutions/` and generate technical specs in `spec/technical/`
4. Use the specs as the starting point for new iterations

```

## Repository & worktree rules

To avoid accidental edits in the scaffold repository and ensure a clean separation between specification and implementation, follow these rules strictly:

- All implementation work MUST be done inside the project directories under `solutions/`. The root repo is a scaffolding/spec repository and should only contain specs, prompts, agents, and instructions. Do NOT add or modify source code under the root repo.
- Clone project repositories directly into `solutions/` using their GitHub name (plain `git clone` from within the `solutions/` folder): e.g. `cd solutions && git clone <url>` produces `solutions/acme-api/`.
- Create git worktrees for feature branches at `solutions/worktrees/<project-name>/<branch-slug>/`. Example:
  ```bash
  git -C solutions/acme-api worktree add ../worktrees/acme-api/feature-US-01-01-auth -b feature/US-01-01-auth main
  ```
- **Cross-project stories**: A single user story can touch multiple projects. Create one worktree per affected project. The story spec's `projects` field lists which repos are involved.
- The backlog and story definitions live in `spec/iterations/...` in the root repo. Use those files as the authoritative source of truth for which stories to implement and their acceptance criteria.
- Before starting a story, scan ALL relevant project directories under `solutions/` for any existing or partially implemented code. If code exists, update or extend it — do not re-implement functionality that already exists.
- Parallelism rule: only run stories in parallel when they belong to the same story-group (i.e., the middle segment is identical). For example, `US-01-01`, `US-01-02` may run in parallel (same `01` group). Do NOT parallelize stories across different groups. When in doubt, complete stories with smaller last-segment numbers first (e.g., finish `US-01-01` before `US-02-01`).
- Dependency rule: check `dependencies` in the story front-matter and `todo_deps` in the session DB before dispatching agents. Do not start a story that depends on unfinished work.
- When creating or updating branches, prefer small, reviewable commits and open a PR in the relevant project repo for code changes. The root repo PRs should be limited to spec/iteration/backlog changes only.
- If an accidental change to the root repo is required (rare), ask for explicit confirmation before committing.

These rules will be enforced by agents when running iterations. Update this section if your team workflow differs.

## Tooling & search guidance

- The `solutions/` directory contains multiple nested Git repositories. Search and file tools do not automatically traverse nested repos — always operate explicitly inside the target project when inspecting or modifying implementation code.
- Preferred file discovery commands (use these when in doubt):
  - `git -C solutions/<project-name> ls-files '<pattern>'` — preferred for tracked files
  - PowerShell: `Get-ChildItem -Path .\solutions\<project-name> -Recurse -Filter *.java`
  - For targeted patterns use explicit paths: e.g. `solutions\acme-api\src\main\java\**\*.java`
- The glob tool in this environment may not match files inside nested repos. If a glob returns no matches, verify with `git -C solutions/<project>` or PowerShell `Get-ChildItem`.
- When creating worktrees or branches for implementation, run commands targeting the nested repo:
  ```bash
  git -C solutions/acme-api worktree add ../worktrees/acme-api/feature-US-01-01 -b feature/US-01-01-auth main
  ```
- Automation and agents MUST perform a pre-check: confirm the project directory exists and `git -C solutions/<project> rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` before assuming files are present.
- To list all available projects: `ls solutions/` or `Get-ChildItem -Path .\solutions -Directory -Exclude worktrees`.

These guidelines reduce mistakes when tools or agents search for sources and will be enforced by agents and CI checks.

## Copilot CLI — Platform notes (Windows vs macOS / Linux)

- **Windows (PowerShell)**:
  - Ensure PowerShell execution policy allows running scripts when installing or invoking the CLI: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force`.
  - Environment variables (temporary): `$env:NAME='value'`. To persist env vars use `setx NAME "value"`.
  - Path and quoting: prefer double-quotes for paths with spaces. Many tools accept forward slashes (`/`) — prefer them for cross-platform compatibility.
  - If repository scripts assume POSIX tools (bash, sh), prefer running Copilot CLI from **Git Bash** or **WSL** to avoid subtle differences.

- **macOS / Linux (bash, zsh)**:
  - Export variables with `export NAME=value`.
  - Make local scripts executable when needed: `chmod +x ./script.sh`.
  - Shell quoting rules differ from PowerShell: use single quotes to prevent expansion, double quotes to allow it.

- **Cross-platform tips**:
  - Always run the Copilot CLI from the workspace root so relative paths and multi-repo worktrees resolve correctly.
  - When sharing examples in prompts or scripts, use forward slashes in paths and avoid shell-specific syntax unless you document it.
  - For nested git repositories and worktrees, prefer `git -C <repo> <command>` to avoid cwd confusion across shells.
  - If you want consistent Unix-like behavior on Windows, use WSL or Git Bash rather than PowerShell for automation scripts.

## Copilot CLI Autopilot / "Dark Factory" tips

- **Design prompts and specs first**: put high-level requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria in `spec/` (OpenSpec/.prompt.md). Autopilot works best when it has a clear spec to follow.

- **Prefer many small, explicit tasks**: break large work into focused prompts (one intent per prompt). This reduces ambiguity and makes autopilot decisions predictable.

- **Use agent personas and skills**: include the intended agent/skill in the prompt (see `.github/agents/` and `.agents/skills/`) so agents follow expected conventions and patterns.

- **Dry-run / review-first**: run Autopilot in preview/no-commit or review mode (if available) to inspect suggested changes before automatic commits or pushes. Always validate large changes manually first.

- **Worktree strategy**: create git worktrees per project/feature and point Autopilot at the worktree directories. This keeps cross-project changes isolated and safely reversible.

- **Constrain iterations and side-effects**: set clear iteration limits and explicit branching/commit rules in the prompt (branch naming, commit message templates, whether to open a PR, etc.).

- **Monitor and intervene on ambiguity**: Autopilot excels at routine, well-scoped work. For design choices, ambiguous tradeoffs, or security-sensitive code, pause autopilot and request human review.

- **Safety checklist to include in prompts**:
  - No hard-coded secrets (always mention secrets management).
  - Tests and linters must pass locally before commits are made.
  - Generate small, reviewable commits (one logical change per commit).

These additions are intended as pragmatic, platform-aware guidance for running Copilot CLI and using Autopilot effectively with the FORGE template.

## Agent Roles Available

Each agent in `.github/agents/` represents a specialized Copilot persona:

- **Solution Architect** — High-level design, technology decisions
- **Business Analyst** — Requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria
- **Project Manager** — Timeline, risk, stakeholder communication
- **Scrum Master** — Agile ceremonies, backlog health, flow
- **Tech Lead** — Technical standards, code quality, architecture enforcement
- **Java Backend Developer** — Spring Boot, WebFlux, Spring Cloud
- **React Frontend Developer** — React, TypeScript, UI/UX
- **Mobile Developer** — Expo React Native (Android/iOS)
- **DevOps Engineer** — AWS infrastructure, Terraform, Jenkins, and deployment systems
- **QA Engineer** — Testing strategy, automation, quality gates

To invoke an agent persona, reference the agent file at the start of your Copilot session:
```
@workspace Read .github/agents/java-backend-developer.md and act as this agent.
```

## Key Behavioral Rules for Copilot

When operating in this workspace, Copilot **MUST**:

1. **Be interactive** — Always ask clarifying questions before generating large artifacts. Confirm understanding before proceeding.
2. **Follow the SDLC flow** — Do not skip phases. Frame before Generate. Obstruct before Reconstruct.
3. **Respect specifications** — All generated code must trace back to a spec in `spec/`. Do not invent requirements.
4. **Use OpenSpec format** — All specifications must follow the OpenSpec.dev format defined in `.github/instructions/openspec-format.md`.
5. **API-First** — Before implementing any REST endpoint, the OpenAPI spec must exist and be agreed in `spec/technical/api-contracts.yaml`. Follow `.github/skills/api-first.md` for conventions.
6. **Expo mobile work follows the mobile skill** — For Expo/React Native stories, follow `.github/skills/expo-react-native.md` for route structure, state, API communication, notifications, config, and anti-patterns.
7. **React web work follows the web skill** — For React website and admin UI stories, follow `.github/skills/react-web-frontend.md` for feature routing, CRUD structure, API clients, forms, entity patterns, state, and anti-patterns.
8. **Large React data grids follow the table skill** — For huge virtualized CRUD tables, also follow `.github/skills/react-virtualized-crud-tables.md` for bounded-memory paging, state-manager contracts, toolbar orchestration, and row-action update patterns.
9. **AWS infrastructure work follows the AWS skills** — For Terraform + Jenkins infrastructure changes, follow `.github/skills/aws-terraform-jenkins-infrastructure.md` for stack boundaries, state handling, env files, parameter stacks, and AWS design rules, and follow `.github/skills/aws-ecs-fargate-runtime-deployments.md` for ECS/Fargate runtime, image delivery, ALB integration, and rollout rules.
10. **Use low-cost models by default** — Default to `GPT-5 Mini` for routine execution work such as backlog grooming, iteration planning, generation, editing, tests, refactors, docs, and implementation. Use a premium model only for high-level analysis tasks such as greenfield framing, brownfield analysis, large architecture trade-off analysis, or when the user explicitly asks for it.
11. **Agent fidelity** — When acting as an agent, stay in that role. Do not conflate responsibilities.
12. **Document decisions** — Every significant decision (architectural, product, technical) must be recorded as an ADR or spec entry.
13. **Small, reviewable commits** — Generate code in small, logically coherent units. Each story = one branch + one PR per project.
14. **Test-first mindset** — When generating implementation code, also generate corresponding tests.
15. **Security by default** — Never generate code with hardcoded secrets, insecure defaults, or known vulnerability patterns.
16. **Confirm before destructive actions** — Before deleting, overwriting, or making breaking changes, ask the user to confirm.
17. **Git commit authorship** — All commits and PRs must be authored as user which would be set. Use `git -c user.name='<set user>' -c user.email='<set email>' commit ...`. Do NOT add a `Co-authored-by: Copilot` trailer or any other co-author to any commit message.
18. **Multi-project awareness** — When implementing a story, check its `projects` field to determine which repositories under `solutions/` are affected. Create worktrees and branches in each affected project.
